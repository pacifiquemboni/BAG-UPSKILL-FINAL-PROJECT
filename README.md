# BAG-UPSKILL-FINAL-PROJECT
This is final project for designing To-do list app using html css and javascript in BAG UPSKILL

## User Interface (HTML/CSS):
Create a clean and user-friendly interface.

Use HTML to structure your page with elements such as input fields, buttons, and lists.

Style the application using CSS. Ensure it is visually appealing and easy to navigate.

## Adding Tasks (JavaScript/CSS):
Implement a text input field where users can type their tasks.

Add a 'Submit' button that adds the task to the to-do list.

Each task should be displayed as a list item in an unordered list.

New tasks should appear at the top of the list.

### #Tasks (JavaScript):
Next to each task, add a 'Delete' button.

When a user clicks the 'Delete' button, the corresponding task should be removed from the list.

### #Prioritizing Tasks (JavaScript/CSS):
Allow users to mark tasks as 'Important'. This could be done by adding a button or by clicking on the task itself.

Important tasks should be visually distinct (e.g., highlighted with a different color).

Optionally, implement a feature to sort or move important tasks to the top of the list.

### Local Storage (Optional JavaScript):
Use local storage to save the tasks, so they are still visible when the user reloads the page.


# Advanced Features (Optional):

### Task Editing:
Allow users to edit the text of existing tasks.
## Task Completion:
Implement a feature to mark tasks as completed (e.g., a checkbox next to each task).

Completed tasks can be styled differently (e.g., strikethrough the text).

### Categories or Tags:
Enable users to assign categories or tags to tasks and filter tasks based on these categories.
### Responsive Design:
Ensure that the application is usable on various devices, including mobile phones and tablets.
